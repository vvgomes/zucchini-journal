## Pirate

Pirate drives a school bus outta town

Sailing through the mild depressive crowd

Starting on Monday

Everything’s the same

Suicide thoughts hanging by the shroud


Pirate wants you feeling good tonight

Humanized perception of the lights

Bertrand Russel son

Getting nothing done

Heavy suitcase many flights of stairs


Classic cowboy writes about the past

White hat cobra languishing so fast

Sending love and hate

Someone to be blamed

Eye-patch color blindness underdressed


Pirate drives a stolen motor boat

Trades illegal goods with Billy Goat

Purify his mind

Nineteen eighty five

Green tea for two lovers you don’t know


Pirate tries to keep his low profile

Friend has sharp knives, enemy has doubts

Ego death at night

Jet boots feel so high

Sidewalk street light glowing your blackout


Concrete tingling legs will keep you stuck 

Grotesque ego owners can’t do drugs

Pirate’s not a friend

Won’t see you again

Silent heart in point of no return


Pirate comes back, offers you a dream

Laughs in overwhelming self-esteem 

Sea storm won’t be long

Distant old folk song

Years later waking up downstream


Doctor sends you home as you may die

Pirate writes a letter in despise

You have passed away

On a sunny day

Anxious lover waiting for next time
