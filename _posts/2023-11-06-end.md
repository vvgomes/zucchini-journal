## End

In his hands and in his heart

What no one cares about

Last time he was ever seen in town

No time for all pending thoughts

No love to remain

Stepping out his old self once again

We're coming back home tonight

We're leaving old names behind

Take me away, this is

The last trip of your life

We're coming back home tonight

We're leaving all plans behind

Nobody is there to see

The last day of your life

Made up personality

Virtual real life

Once again till seven forty five

Boxes full of memories

All from better times

Last time he was ever told to lie

We're coming back home tonight

We're leaving old names behind

Take me away, this is

The last trip of your life

We're coming back home tonight

We're leaving all plans behind

Nobody is there to see

The last day of your life
