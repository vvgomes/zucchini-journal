## Narcissist

The Giver is someone who finds joy in serving others. They have a natural inclination to do good things to people around them. Givers will seek other people's needs in order to take action. Givers will give gifts, experiences, attention, love. Many times the Giver forgets about themselves in the benefit of others.

The Narcissist is someone addicted to attention. They see themselves as special beings. They are utterly selfish and manipulative. The Narcissist demonstrates a chronic dissatisfaction so that people feel compelled to serve them. They're seductive and, at first sight, innocent. The Narcissist never prioritizes anyone else but themselves, regardless of circumstances or consequences.

When the Giver and the Narcissist connect a chain reaction starts. A parasite infects a host body and starts to consume it gradually but slowly.

In the beginning, everything seems to make sense. The Narcissist asks for attention and the Giver has plenty of it to give out. A perfect match. The Narcissist finds reassurance on their sense of specialty. The Giver finds joy by serving their starving master.

Nevertheless, the Narcissist has infinite demands and suffers from eternal dissatisfaction. They display frustration about small and big things. Their home, their past, their future, their boredom, their lack of joy. As a consequence, the Giver invests an increasing amount of energy and resources to keep the Narcissist from complaining.

As a parasite though, the Narcissist sometimes will slow demands down. They don't want to kill their host too fast. They need to keep the Giver alive for as long as it is convenient for them. Therefore, from time to time the Narcissist will award the Giver with little alms of false love. This cycle can last for a long human time.

Inevitably, the Giver will collapse. High anxiety, panic attacks, health problems. This is their body protesting against the abusive treatment they're receiving. At this stage, the Narcissist makes sure to establish a narrative where this is all the Giver's fault. Their incompetence and lack of awareness about the Narcissistic needs. 

The Narcissist says they are actually the victim. That they're trapped and overwhelmed by the Givers excessive care. That they need freedom. This is how they will justify their acts of abuse.

Now the Giver is completely drained. Exhausted. Dehumanized. Blamed. They became useless to the Narcissist - who is ready to leave and find a new host.

By making sure the Giver feels culprit, the Narcissist leaves a door open to a future connection. They know the Giver might eventually recover. And they know the next Giver will eventually drain too. The Narcissist wants to have options.

The Narcissist is an evil being. The Giver is a person of high value.

In this world, however, evil beings get what they want. People of high value are the ones who suffer.

Givers can survive. I've survived. But not without trauma and lifelong wounds.
