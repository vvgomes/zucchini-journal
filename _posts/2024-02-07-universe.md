## Universe

We plant seeds to the universe

They might sprout sometimes

But we learn not to expect anything

As the universe remains blind, unjust

There’s pointless suffering

There’s pointless joy

We get angry at times, we get tired

We want to fight the universe back

Though there’s only one way to hurt the universe

We hurt the universe by denying it

When we refrain from being part of it

When we refuse donating life to it

When we leave the universe behind for good

We can only hurt the universe by ceasing to exist
