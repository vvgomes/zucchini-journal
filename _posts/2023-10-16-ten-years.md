## Ten Years

The time it takes to finish school.

The time it takes for a child to build a personality.

The time it takes to read dozens of books.

The time it takes to write a few books.

The time it takes to change your mind several times.

The time it takes to love several people.

The time it takes to build something meaningful.

The time it takes to master a skill.

The time it takes to experience great things.

The time it takes to heal from difficult things.

Ten years go by fast when you are young.

Ten years is about 15% of you whole life.

Ten years is about one third of our youth life.

Ten years is a lot to lose.
