## Blind

You were young.

You were raw.

You were real.

You had dreams.

You had feelings.

You had an open heart.

You were special.

You were nature.

You were source.

You were energy.

You were love.

But you were blind.

Unable to see yourself.

Your whole being.

.

You were offered a taste.

The taste of your own blood.

You got old.

You got false.

You no longer dream.

You no longer feel.

You closed your heart.

You blended with them all.

You became artificial.

You consumed.

You desired.

You hated.

You pleasured.

You suffered.

But you are no longer blind. 

You can finally see yourself.

Your own remainings.
