## Equivalence

The city fronts chase you.

The bottom of the ocean implodes me.

The city fronts have their eyes on you.

The bottom of the ocean has its pressure on my bones.

The city fronts empathize with your motives.

The bottom of the ocean ignores my pain.

There you have a front seat.

Here I have no air to breath.

There is no equivalence.
